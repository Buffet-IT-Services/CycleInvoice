    Generic update service meant to be reused in local update services.

    :param instance: The model instance to be updated.
    :param fields: A list of field names that should be updated.
    :param data: A dictionary containing the new values for the fields.
    :param auto_updated_at: If True, will automatically update the `updated_at` field if it exists.

    :return: A tuple containing the updated instance and a boolean indicating whether any fields were updated.

    Some important notes:
        - Only keys present in `fields` will be taken from `data`.
        - If something is present in `fields` but not present in `data`, we simply skip.
        - There's a strict assertion that all values in `fields` are actual fields in `instance`.
        - `fields` can support m2m fields, which are handled after the update on `instance`.
        - If `auto_updated_at` is True, we'll try bumping `updated_at` with the current timestmap.
